## Environment

To define environment variables we are using: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/. The available variables are:

**REACT_APP_TERRASO_ENV**: Terraso Environment
**REACT_APP_TERRASO_API_URL**: Terraso API host URL
**REACT_APP_ROLLBAR_TOKEN**: Rollbar token
**REACT_APP_COOKIES_DOMAIN**: Cookie domain
**REACT_APP_HUBSPOT_FORMS_PORTAL_ID**: HubSpot portal ID
**REACT_APP_HUBSPOT_FORMS_CONTACT_FORM_EN**: HubSpot English form ID
**REACT_APP_HUBSPOT_FORMS_CONTACT_FORM_ES**: HubSpot Epanish form ID
**REACT_APP_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN**: Plausible domain configuration

To modify these variables inside the docker environment change the `local.env` file

### Run command with custom variable value directly with npm:

Start: `REACT_APP_TERRASO_API_URL=https://api.terraso.org/graphql npm start`

Build: `REACT_APP_TERRASO_API_URL=https://api.terraso.org/graphql npm run build`

## Localization

The localization is being hangled by the `react-i18next`. You can check the documentation here: [https://react.i18next.com/](https://react.i18next.com/)

### Generate PO files

Executing `make localization-to-po` will generate the PO files in `locales/po/` from the JSON files in `src/localization/locales/`

### Generate JSON files

Executing `make localization-to-json` will generate the JSON files in `src/localization/locales/` from the PO files in `locales/po/`

## Contact Form

The contact section integrates with HubSpot to display it in the application. To gather the configuration needed for the Hubsport environment variables (`REACT_APP_HUBSPOT_FORMS_REGION`, `REACT_APP_HUBSPOT_FORMS_PORTAL_ID`, `REACT_APP_HUBSPOT_FORMS_CONTACT_FORM_EN`, `REACT_APP_HUBSPOT_FORMS_CONTACT_FORM_ES`) get it for you form URL that should have this strcuture:

`https://app.hubspot.com/forms/{portal ID}/editor/{form ID}/edit/form`

## Analytics

The application is built to work with Plausible, to configure the domain Plausible will use you have to set the `REACT_APP_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN` environment variable.

### Remove create-react-app wrapper `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
