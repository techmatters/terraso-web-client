// Using some advanced TypeScript features here: ReturnType gets the
// return type of a function type, and since reducers are just functions
// from (state, action) to state this gives us our state type. since we have
// a store factory instead of a store we need to get our dispatch
// type from the return type of the store factory instead of from the store
// directly as normal. background reading:
